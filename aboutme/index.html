    <p>My name is Moses Diaz. I am a junior and a CIT major. In my free time, I like to bake, play video games, work on my car, exercise, and listen to music. I also enjoy learning to play gutiar and watching anime when I have time. I am from Logan, Utah but am currently living in Rexburg for School. </p>
