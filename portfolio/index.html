                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> My name is Moses Diaz and I am a Junior at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I was born in Rexburg
                    Idaho and
                    raised in Logan Utah. In my free time, I enjoy learning to play guitar, playing video games, baking,
                    spending time
                    outdoors, visiting my family, and working on my car.
                    <br>
                    From a young age, I have always had an interest in technology. I loved learning how to use computers
                    and the
                    typing classes I was able to take while in elementary school.
                    As I progressed into college, I was able to take my first class in Computer Information Technology.
                    I was caught
                    by the satisfaction that I was able to gain from writing a program and seeing my work come to life.
                    After taking that first class, I began pursuing a technology degree. Since then I have been able to
                    gain
                    experience writing code in Java, Javascript, C++, Python, and SQL.
                    I have also had the opportunity to learn about Cisco switch and router configuration as well as gain
                    a basic
                    understanding of linux server administration.
                    As I work to finish my degree in Computer Information Technology, I am also working to gain
                    certifications in
                    Linux and Cybersecurity through CompTIA as well as a CCNA certification.
                    <br>
                    I have also been privileged to have the opportunity to work at my university's IT Service Desk. It
                    has been an
                    experience that has taught me a lot about what it means to work in a technology environment. I feel
                    I have gained
                    invaluable experience in learning how to convey technological information to people who are
                    uncomfortable using
                    technology. I have also been able to gain experience managing a team, conducting
                    meetings, and hiring new employees since receiving promotions at this job.
                    <br>
                    Continuous learning is something that I feel is very important. Because the way we use and interact
                    with technology continues to change, I felt that it would be a career path that would always present
                    me with the
                    opportunity to expand my skills and knowledge. As I look forward to graduating, I would like the
                    opportunity to
                    work in the field of cybersecurity.
