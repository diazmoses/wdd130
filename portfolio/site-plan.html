      About Me <br>
      My name is Moses Diaz and I am a Junior at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I was born in Rexburg Idaho and
      raised in Logan Utah. In my free time, I enjoy learning to play guitar, playing video games, baking, spending time
      outdoors, visiting my family, and working on my car.
      <br>
      From a young age, I have always had an interest in technology. I loved learning how to use computers and the
      typing classes I was able to take while in elementary school.
      As I progressed into college, I was able to take my first class in Computer Information Technology. I was caught
      by the satisfaction that I was able to gain from writing a program and seeing my work come to life.
      After taking that first class, I began pursuing a technology degree. Since then I have been able to gain
      experience writing code in Java, Javascript, C++, Python, and SQL.
      I have also had the opportunity to learn about Cisco switch and router configuration as well as gain a basic
      understanding of linux server administration.
      As I work to finish my degree in Computer Information Technology, I am also working to gain certifications in
      Linux and Cybersecurity through CompTIA as well as a CCNA certification.
      <br>
      I have also been privileged to have the opportunity to work at my university's IT Service Desk. It has been an
      experience that has taught me a lot about what it means to work in a technology environment. I feel I have gained
      invaluable experience in learning how to convey technological information to people who are uncomfortable using
      technology. I have also been able to gain experience managing a team, conducting
      meetings, and hiring new employees since receiving promotions at this job.
      <br>
      Continuous learning is something that I feel is very important. Because the way we use and interact
      with technology continues to change, I felt that it would be a career path that would always present me with the
      opportunity to expand my skills and knowledge. As I look forward to graduating, I would like the opportunity to
      work in the field of cybersecurity.
